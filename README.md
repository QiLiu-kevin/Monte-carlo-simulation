# 2020-PHYS-Project
The Monte-Carlo method is very widely used to simulate physical processes, and is also used do numerical integration, particularly in the field of finance. In this project you will develop an understanding of Monte-Carlo radiation transport, and apply it to the movement of neutrons in a nuclear reactor. The example of a dilute thermal homogenous nuclear reactor will be modelled, and you will obtain by Monte Carlo simulation the parameters of such a reactor such that it becomes critical.  
This is a change to the readme.  
TODO:  
1. Add comments.  
2. Rewrite code into OOP style.  
3. Add mixture mediums.
